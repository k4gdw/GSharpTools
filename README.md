GSharpTools, aka GTools
=======================

Generously provided FREE of charge by  [Gerson  Kurz][1]  via  his  [web
site][2].

This is the source code that is installed with the latest version of the
most excellent GTools package which is available for  [download here][3]
or, you can clone this repository and build it yourself.

Branches:
---------

 *  `master` - This is the source code as supplied by Mr. Kurz. The only
    modification is the addition of this README file. I will keep an eye
    on the web page and if Mr. Kurz makes  any  updates  they  will  get 
    merged in as quickly as I notice them.

 *  `dev` - This is where I will make  any  modifications  such  as  new 
    features or bug fixes.
